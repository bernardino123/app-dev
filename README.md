## Introduction

The "Mission: Impossible" franchise is a series of action spy films that originated from the 1960s television series of the same name. The film series, however, began in 1996 with the release of "Mission: Impossible," directed by Brian De Palma and starring Tom Cruise as the lead character, Ethan Hunt.

The overarching theme of the "Mission: Impossible" series revolves around the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), a fictional clandestine organization that undertakes high-stakes covert missions. The IMF is known for its top-secret and seemingly impossible tasks, often involving espionage, infiltration, and the prevention of catastrophic events.

## Plot Summary
When U.S. government operative Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his mentor, Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), go on a covert assignment that takes a disastrous turn, Jim is killed, and Ethan becomes the prime murder suspect. Now a fugitive, Hunt recruits brilliant hacker Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and maverick pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to help him sneak into a heavily guarded CIA building to retrieve a confidential computer file that will prove his innocence.
